\section{Lab 1: Calculator Program using C}

\subsection{Objective}
The objective of this lab is to develop a basic calculator program using the C programming language. The calculator will perform simple arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on user input.

\subsection{Program Overview}
The calculator program is designed to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Accept two numbers from the user.
    \item Prompt the user to select an arithmetic operation (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division).
    \item Perform the selected operation.
    \item Display the result of the operation to the user.
\end{itemize}

The program includes error handling to manage division by zero and other invalid inputs.

\subsection{Code Implementation}
The following is the C code for the calculator program:

\begin{verbatim}
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    char operator;
    double num1, num2, result;

    printf("Enter an operator (+, -, *, /): ");
    scanf("%c", &operator);

    printf("Enter two operands: ");
    scanf("%lf %lf", &num1, &num2);

    switch(operator) {
        case '+':
            result = num1 + num2;
            break;
        case '-':
            result = num1 - num2;
            break;
        case '*':
            result = num1 * num2;
            break;
        case '/':
            if (num2 != 0)
                result = num1 / num2;
            else {
                printf("Error! Division by zero.\n");
                return -1;
            }
            break;
        default:
            printf("Error! Operator is not correct\n");
            return -1;
    }

    printf("Result: %.2lf\n", result);
    return 0;

    \subsection{Compiling and Running the Program}
To compile and run the calculator program:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Open a terminal or command prompt.
    \item Navigate to the directory where the C file is located.
    \item Compile the program using a C compiler (e.g., GCC):
    \begin{verbatim}
    gcc calculator.c -o calculator
    \end{verbatim}
    \item Run the compiled program:
    \begin{verbatim}
    ./calculator
    \end{verbatim}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Adding the Calculator Program to GitHub Repository}

\section{Symbol Mind Reading Java Application}

\subsection{Description}
This Java AWT application is a simple graphical program that simulates a mind-reading trick. The user is prompted to think of any two-digit number, reverse the digits, and find the difference between the original and reversed numbers. The user then finds the resulting number in a grid of symbols, each labeled with a number from 0 to 98.

The twist of the program is that all numbers divisible by 9 share the same symbol, which is randomly generated each time the program runs. This symbol is eventually revealed as the "mind-read" symbol when the user clicks the \texttt{Submit} button.

\subsection{Features}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Grid of Symbols:} The main window displays a grid of 99 symbols, each paired with a number from 0 to 98.
    \item \textbf{Random Special Symbol:} A random symbol is assigned to all positions in the grid that are divisible by 9.
    \item \textbf{Instructional Message:} The application provides a brief message at the top of the window that guides the user through the mental trick.
    \item \textbf{Submit Button:} Once the user is ready, they click the \texttt{Submit} button to reveal the special symbol in a refreshed window.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{How It Works}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The user is instructed to think of a two-digit number, reverse its digits, and subtract the smaller number from the larger number.
    \item The user then finds the result in the grid of symbols and memorizes the corresponding symbol.
    \item When the user clicks the \texttt{Submit} button, the application clears the grid and displays the special symbol associated with all multiples of 9, "reading the user's mind."
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{How to Run}
To run the program:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Compile the Java file using \texttt{javac SymbolApp.java}.
    \item Run the compiled class using \texttt{java SymbolApp}.
    \item The application window will appear, and the user can follow the on-screen instructions.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Customization}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The special symbol is generated randomly at the start of the application. You can modify the range of ASCII characters used for generating the symbol in the code if desired.
    \item The grid layout and other UI elements are customizable through the \texttt{GridLayout} and other layout managers used in the AWT framework.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Button Customization}
The button has been customized as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
// Original Button Setup
submitButton = new Button("Chin Tapak Dum Dum");
submitButton.setPreferredSize(new Dimension(250, 60)); // Make the button larger
submitButton.setFont(new Font("Serif", Font.BOLD | Font.ITALIC, 20)); // Change font style
submitButton.setBackground(Color.RED); // Set background color
submitButton.setForeground(Color.WHITE); // Set text color
submitButton.setCursor(new Cursor(Cursor.HAND_CURSOR)); // Change cursor when hovering
\end{verbatim}

These modifications include changing the button's label to \texttt{"Chin Tapak Dum Dum"}, resizing the button, adjusting the font style, and altering the button's color scheme to enhance its appearance and usability.

 \end{itemize}
 \section{ Introduction to \LaTeX}

\subsection{Abstract}
This document serves as a brief introduction to \LaTeX, a widely-used typesetting system. 
    It covers the basics of document structure, formatting, mathematical typesetting, and features 
    like cross-referencing, tables, and figure handling.

\subsection{What is \LaTeX ?}    
\LaTeX\ is a high-quality typesetting system that is widely used for producing scientific and technical
documents. It is not a word processor; instead, \LaTeX\ allows authors to focus on content rather
than design, with an emphasis on logical structure. Developed in the 1980s by Leslie Lamport,
\LaTeX\ builds on Donald Knuth’s \TeX, adding macros to simplify document production.\\


A few key features of \LaTeX\ include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Automatic generation of bibliographies, indexes, and tables of contents.
    \item Handling complex mathematical notations.
    \item Consistent and professional typography.
    \item Easy cross-referencing of sections, equations, and figures.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Document Structure}
Every \LaTeX\ document begins with a document class declaration, which determines the overall
layout. Some common classes are \texttt{article}, \texttt{report}, and \texttt{book}. The document itself is enclosed
between \verb|\begin{document}| and \verb|\end{document}|.\\


Here’s an example of a very simple \LaTeX\ document:
\begin{verbatim}
\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
    \title{Sample Document}
    \author{Author Name}
    \date{\today}
    \maketitle
    \section{Introduction}
    This is the introduction to our document.
\end{document}
\end{verbatim}

You can add sections, subsections, and paragraphs to structure your document logically. \LaTeX\
automatically numbers sections and subsections for you.

\subsubsection{The Preamble}
The preamble is the part of the document before \verb|\begin{document}|. Here, you can load packages
to extend \LaTeX's functionality, set global formatting options, and define custom commands.\\


Example of including a package:
\begin{verbatim}
\usepackage{amsmath} % For advanced math typesetting
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Mathematical Typesetting}
\LaTeX\ excels at typesetting mathematical equations, both inline and as standalone expressions. Inline math is written within \verb|$| symbols, like this: $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$. For larger expressions, the \texttt{equation} environment is used.\\


For example, here’s the quadratic formula:

\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} 
\]

\subsubsection{Dotted Expressions}
Dots are often used to indicate that a pattern continues. You can use different types of dots for
various purposes in mathematical typesetting:
\[
1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
\]
\[
A = \begin{pmatrix}
a_{11} & a_{12} & \cdots & a_{1n} \\
a_{21} & a_{22} & \cdots & a_{2n} \\ 
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
a_{m1} & a_{m2} & \cdots & a_{mn} \\
\end{pmatrix}
\]
In the matrix example, \vdots represents\ vertical\ dots,\ddots represent\ diagonal\ dots, \cdots represents\ horizontal\ dots. 

\subsection{Inserting Figures and Tables}
Including images and tables is simple in \LaTeX. For figures, you use the \texttt{figure} environment and
the \verb|\includegraphics| command.

Here is an example of how to insert a figure:
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{image1.png}
    \caption{Enter Caption}
    \label{fig:enter-label}
\end{figure}
\end{verbatim}
        

Tables are created using the \texttt{table} and \texttt{tabular} environments. For example:
\begin{verbatim}
    \begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
        \hline
        Column 1 & Column 2 & Column 3 \\
        \hline
        1 & 2 & 3 \\
        4 & 5 & 6 \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{A simple table.}
    \label{tab:example}
\end{table}
\end{verbatim}

\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
        \hline
        Column 1 & Column 2 & Column 3 \\
        \hline
        1 & 2 & 3 \\
        4 & 5 & 6 \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{A simple table.}
    \label{tab:example}
\end{table}

\subsection{Cross-Referencing and Citations}
\LaTeX\ provides robust tools for cross-referencing sections, equations, and figures. For example, to reference Figure 1, use the \verb|\ref| command. You can also automatically generate a bibliography by
using \verb|BibTeX| or \verb|BibLaTeX|.

\subsection{Compiling the Document}
To see the formatted output of your \LaTeX\ document, you need to compile it. The most common
compiler is \texttt{pdflatex}, which generates a PDF from your \LaTeX\ source code. Online editors like \textbf{ Overleaf} provide a user-friendly interface for compiling and editing \LaTeX\ documents.

\subsection{Conclusion}
This brief introduction to \LaTeX\ covers its fundamental concepts and features. As you become more comfortable, you can explore advanced topics such as custom commands, style files, and the extensive array of packages available for \LaTeX. It is a powerful tool that ensures professional, consistent document formatting, making it a favorite for researchers, scientists, and academic writers.
